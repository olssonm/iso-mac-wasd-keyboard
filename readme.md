# ISO (SE) Mac layout for WASD V3 keyboards

Mechanical keyboards with a proper ISO layout can be difficult to find. More difficult? A Scandinavian layout. And even yet more difficult? All these combined with a Mac-layout...

After way too much searching and research I ended up designing my own, using the WASD-supplied templates and Illustrator for custom order. And the result was actually a very pleasant surprise, the keyboard is solid too (rough after using chiclet-style keys for 12+ years though.)

With this layout I didn't really try to mimic Apple's keyboards, but instead go for perhaps a more retro layout with a bit smaller letters aligned to the top left. I did however end up using SF pro as the typeface.

Thought I might just as well share this if my Scandinavian friends finds this useful.

### Features

* A function key replaces "insert" just as on Apples own full scale keyboard.
* All function keys has symbols instead for their text counterpart (i.e. ⇪, ⇧, ⌃, ⌥ etc.).
* Uses the unique European Mac symbols for end/home/page down/page up.
* Swedish layout with å, ä, ö. Should be easy to replace with Danish and Norwegian ø and æ if you are so inclined to do so.
* F14 and F15 are custom (which I have bound to my editor of choice and iTerm respectivly).
* And eject key instead of F13 is present, which is perhaps unecessary for 99,99% of all users.


### Hints

* On the WASD keyboard, don't forget to set the dipswitches 1 & 2 to "on" for "Mac mode".
* Use [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) to map any custom keys.
* If you are to place an order on WASD double, tripple and quadrouple check your .ai-file – I made blatant misstake that I wont confess to here (of course fixed in the .ai in this repo.)

### Future ideas

* As I always disable caps lock (Settings -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys -> Caps Lock = No Action), this could be replaced for something better.
